## Project requirements:

#### 1. Your visualization must include:
- a Python Flask–powered RESTful API
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript 
- at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
#### 2. Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
- A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
- A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
- A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
- A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
#### 3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
#### 4. Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
#### 5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
#### 6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
